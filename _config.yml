    A little about myself

    Hi there, I'm Abhishek Nath!
    I'm currently doing my PhD from HighRR group, KIP, Heidelberg University. When I am not working, I binge watch movies a lot, code ( only when I get bored of movies ) and obscurely plan to make a self-financed movie one day. My idea to start a github+Jekyll driven static website originated simply because I wish to learn more about version control and polish my skills on coding but in an interesting way. Read more about myself...
